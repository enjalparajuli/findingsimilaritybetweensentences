# findingsimilaritybetweensentences
This was an assignment for Information Retrieval class. It uses cosine similarity for finding the similarity between the sentences. I have implemented TF-IDF algorithm from scratch because I wanted to know TF-IDF works. On top of that cosine similarity was performed to find the similarity between sentences.
